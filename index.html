Vic : <em>" Go die Martinez! "</em><br>
―Martinez and Vic in the Marked Men quest </p>
      <h4>Build an underground empire</h4>
        <p><em>" Why don't you take over Marty's facilities? "</em>
            ―Louise to Vic</p>
<p>With Marty's death, and with Louise's help, Vic decides to take over Marty and his gang's businesses. After hiring a few henchmen,

    he underworld, forming his own gang, the Vance Crime Family .

After initial success as the boss of a gang. Vic received a text saying that she would meet someone at the airport. It turns out that 
    it is Lance , Vic's younger brother, which is quite disappointing to Vic, because Vic sees Lance as a troublemaker. After a while o
    f arguing, the brothers boarded Vic's red Stinger, but were soon blocked by the Cholos, due to previous clashes and Vic killed many 
    of the Cholos members. Lance then took the wheel and Vic shot back at the attackers, but when they reached an alley, Lance carelessl
    y damaged Vic's car. Vic then manages to escape the Cholos encirclement in the alley and drives Lance to the hotel.

<p>After meeting Lance at the airport, Vic receives a message from Umbero Robina , the boss of the Cuban gang in Vice City, who wa
    nts to work with Vic after hearing that Vic took over Marty's facilities. Vic agrees, but Umberto wants to see if Vic is "toug
    h" enough to be a partner. Vic was asked to retrieve a package from a Cuban member while being chased by other Cuban members. 
    Vic successfully retrieves the package and returns it to Umberto, establishing a bond between the Vance family and Robina.

The missions that Umberto assigns to Vic are related to the war between the Cubans and the Cholos gang. First, Vic is tasked with ki
    lling the Cholos causing trouble around the Umberto area. Umberto also tells Vic that Marty is also a nuisance to his work. Late
    r, Vic meets Umberto crying, because he is worried that his father, Alberto, will be killed by the Cholos because he went out to 
    watch wrestling in the stadium. Vic finds Alberto and brings him back to Café Robina while avoiding the Cholos.

Angry at the Cholos gang's act of wanting to kill his father, Umberto decided to deal with the Cholos once and for all. Vic and the C
    ubans go to a Cholos warehouse, kill the Cholos in the warehouse and steal all the weapons there, leaving a "gift" of explosives 
    for them. The warehouse then explodes, killing many of the Cholos members, including the leader. The Cholos Pirates were destroye
    d with Vic and Umberto splitting to take over their facilities.

Agent DEA
Lance found a partner, Bryan Forbes , who told Lance about the white shipments being shipped into Vice City. Arriving at King Knut's B
    urger bar, Lance called Forbes when three guys burst into the bar trying to rob the bar. Vic and Lance escape while the police thi
    nk the brothers are robbers. Running to the Port Authority Building, Vic and Lance get the Forbes car and then Lance drives to Forbes.

Vic was later introduced to Forbes at Lance's apartment, while the two were talking. The three took a truck full of white goods while a
    voiding the attention of the police, Vic took another truck as bait to deceive the police. After Lance and Forbes arrived, Vic manag
    ed to escape the police pursuit.

Later, Lance discovered that Forbes was in fact an undercover agent of the DEA. Lance pointed a gun at him, but he was able to get into t
    he car to escape from the Vance brothers. But Vic and Lance chase him and capture him alive, taking him to a construction site in Litt
    le Haiti to get more information.

Tied up, Forbes told the brothers about a merchant who could give them both money and goods, but he only accepted a one-on-one transactio
    n, so Lance decided to make the transaction while Vic would watch from afar. The dock trade turns out to be a trap, and the other guy
    knocks out and kidnaps Lance. Vic chases after, saves Lance and kills the other guy and his associates, the Sharks.

Vic and Lance return to the Forbes detention center, wanting more information on the white shipments. Forbes said he had an acquaintance 
    at the White Stallionz bar. Turns out to be a trap, Vic and Lance are surrounded by a gang of gay motorbikes. After killing them all an
    d escaping, the brothers returned to find Forbes had untied the ropes and was about to escape. Vic and Lance give chase, kill Forbes and get his ID.</p>

<h4>White goods and mother</h4?
<p>Vic walks into Lance's hotel room, throws his phone on the floor and intends to smack Lance for causing trouble. Suddenly Janet Vance, Vic and Lance's
    mother, walks in with her boyfriend, Javier, telling her she's recovered from drugs but the brothers ignore her. Lance told Vic about "some goods" on 
    his way to the city by air at Escobar International Airport. When they got there, the seller told them that the "goods" had been sold before because h
    e was afraid he had a group of security guards. Vic and Lance go to airport terminal C to find the buyer and kill him, taking the item.

Lance later learns that the shipment belongs to Martinez. The two decided to steal Martinez's goods for themselves. At the harbor in Little Haiti, Vic and
    Lance kill some of Martinez's men, steal two Barracks OL trucks full of opium, and avoid the Martinez men. On the bridge leading to Washington Beach, 
    the two were chased by Martinez and attacked by a Hunter helicopter. Both escaped because there was a policeman standing on the other side of the brid
    ge and carrying the drugs to the new house.

At the new home, Vic calls Martinez, taunting him. Martinez said that the goods Vic just robbed actually belonged to two brothers Diego and Armando Mendez 
    and that they would kill anyone involved with their goods, including Vic and Martinez himself. Lance told Vic there was someone who would buy the goods 
    and with the money the Mendez brothers wouldn't be able to do anything to them. When they arrived at North Point Mall in Vice Point, Vic and Lance met S
    pitz, a shopper who said he needed a stuntman to complete the horror movie in the supermarket before it opened. Vic decides to act and Lance trades with 
    Spitz. When the job is done, Vic and Lance return to Lance's mansion in Ocean Beach to get the rest of the drugs, but when they return, they discover tha
    t her mother and boyfriend have taken all the drugs.</p>
